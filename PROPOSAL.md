  # Fianl Project Proposal
  
  My final project proposal is to create a remake of the classic game Asteroids. This would be a game where a player takes control of some ship, is able to move around a small space area, and must try to stay alive and get as high a score as possible. To do this, the player will be able to 
* move their ship with thrust
* rotate their ship
* shoot pellets from the nozzle of the ship
The player will face asteroids of different sizes and speeds, and must do their best to either shoot the oncoming asteroids or dodge them.
  
  The background knowledge I have on this kind of project is developing 2D games in unity, such as flappy bird and Pac Man. The reason I want to do this project is because I want to make a 2D game that is interesting and fun to play. I will be motivated to complete such a game with as much refinement and detail as I can, so as to create a fun gameplay loop that someone can sink a lot of time into.
  
  A rought timeline of this project would involve breaking down the most important components to be completed over the 3 weeks. The first week would involve creating the basic movement of the ship and the asteroid objects, and making sure the ship can thrust and rotate. The second week would involve implementing the basic physics of the game, such as asteroid collisions, the ship getting hit by an asteroid, as well as implementing the shooting mechanic. The third week would oversee the gameplay loop, which would involve things such as the player score and increasing difficulty over time with bigger asteroids, as well as details such as astroids getting shot and splitting into more rocks. 
  
  If these goals are met earlier than expected, then I can also implement some extra features to spice up the gameplay. These could include power-ups from the asteroids such as temporary invulnerability, higher firing power, and extra health. I could also try implementing special asteroids. This could include homing asteroids which target the player ship, or explosive asteroids which will destroy asteroids in a certain radius.
